#TYPE# for Debian
---------------------------

Please see ./README for a description of the #TYPE# software.

The Debian #TYPE# source package provides two packages,

 1) #TYPE#-user, which the provides the 32 bit and 64 bit userspace library
 2) #TYPE#-source, which provides the source for the kernel modules
 3) #TYPE#-dev, which provides header files for development with onload

The #TYPE#-source package can be used in several ways,

 - Using the modules-assistant(8) command to automatically build and install
   the #TYPE#-modules package for the Debian kernel-image package
   that you are using.  See the modules-assistant(8) man page.

 - Using the make-kpkg(1) command provided by the kernel-package Debian
   package. This will produce a corresponding #TYPE#-modules package
   for the Debian kernel-image package that you are using. See
   the "modules_image" section of the make-kpkg(1) man page.

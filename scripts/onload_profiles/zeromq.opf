# OpenOnload profile for applications using zeromq.

# Zeromq uses unix sockets for inter-thread communication, and blocks using
# poll() and epoll().  The following options ensure that the messages
# passed through unix sockets are not delayed.
onload_set EF_POLL_FAST_USEC 0
onload_set EF_POLL_NONBLOCK_FAST_USEC 0

# We also recommend that you use the latency profile.

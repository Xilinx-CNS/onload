/* This file is included in a number of different environments to obtain a
   representation of configuration options.  It must contain ONLY C
   pre-procesor symbols.

   It must include one instance of the macro
   
       CI_CFG_OPTFILE_VERSION(version) - version of this option set
       
   This version number should be incremented if the meaning of current or
   former option names changes.

   It then has an arbitrary number of
   
       CI_CFG_OPT(env, name, type, doc, type_modifier, group, default,
                  min, max, presentation)

   option definitions:

       env           - a string giving the enviornment variable used to control
                       this option.
       name          - the C name of this option
       type          - an integer C type used to hold the option in
       doc           - a user-facing documentation documentation string
                       describing the option
       type_modifier - an integer giving size of the bitfield it is in or
                       an alignment requirement A<n> for aligning on an
		       <n>-byte boundary
       group         - a name for the option group this option belongs to,
                       by default (if nothing is placed in this field)
		       the name (above) is used
                       option groups define sets of options all of which must
		       be defined if any are
       default       - the value to which the option should be initialized
                       the values MIN, MAX, SMIN, SMAX can be used to refer to
		       the unsigned and signed minimum and maximum values that
		       fit in the field
       min           - the integer minimum value the option can hold
                       the values MIN, MAX, SMIN, SMAX can be used to refer to
		       the unsigned and signed minimum and maximum values that
		       fit in the field
       max           - the integer maximum value the option can hold
                       the values MIN, MAX, SMIN, SMAX can be used to refer to
		       the unsigned and signed minimum and maximum values that
		       fit in the field
		       Note: currently MAX is unlikely to be treated properly
		       in an unsigned 64-bit field - you should use SMAX
       presentation  - a name for the presentation type used to determine the
                       way this value should be presented to a user currently
		       one of:
		           count	- number of elements in something
		           countln2	- " as a power of two
			   bincount     - number of binary things, e.g. bytes
			   level        - one of a set of relative levels
			   time:sec     - time in seconds
			   time:msec    - time in milliseconds
			   time:usec    - time in microseconds
			   time:tick    - time in host-specific units
			   invcount     - a rate/probability of 1 in this many
			   bitmask      - bit mask
			   bitset:<S1>;..<Sn>
			                - bit set composed of bit 0==S1 |
					  bit 1=S2 ... | <bit n-1=Sn
			   ipaddress    - IP address
			   ipmask       - IP address mask
			   oneof:<S1>;..;<Sn>
			                - enumeration where minimum==S1
			   yesno        - same as oneof:no;yes
			   filename     - name of a file
                      

   Finally it can contain an arbitrary number of
   
       CI_CFG_OPTGROUP(group, category, expertise)

   option group definitions:

       group         - name of the option group (as used in CI_CFG_OPT)
       category      - name for the category of option these options belong to
                       options from the same category may be presented to
		       a user for modification grouped together
		       by default (if nothing is placed in this field)
		       the name of the group is used
       expertise     - an integer giving the expertise level associated with
                       these options
		       options with expertise level greater than that of the
		       user may not be presented to him for modification
		       by default the value 100 should be used

   Option groups generated implicitly by CI_CFG_OPT macros, which are
   unmodified by a CI_CFG_OPTGROUP macro should be considered to have a
   category with the same name as the option group and an expertise level
   equal to 100
*/


/* Please think carefully about packing when adding fields to this data
** structure.  Small fields should be next to each other to avoid wasting
** space.
**
** Please do not remove the sequence  0, MIN, MAX  on every option on the
** grounds that it is common text - they are there as in invitation to
** consider more correct values.

#define MEMORY_PRESSURE_DESCRIPTION \
  "Memory pressure means Onload is out of packet buffers; and will "      \
  "drop packets until it recovers.  However, it only counts as memory "   \
  "pressure if we are unable to fill the RX ring.  Running out of "       \
  "memory for other purposes (e.g. transmit) will not necessarily "       \
  "trigger these counters; if receive is still functioning normally.  "

#define HANDOVER_DESCRIPTION(_x) \
  "All of the handover statistics represent sockets that have been handed "   \
  "to the kernel; and the call that was made that caused this."               \
  "  (In this case " #_x "with a TCP socket)  "                               \
  "Most often, this is caused by routing over a non-accelerated interface "   \
  "(including loopback; see EF_TCP_SERVER_LOOPBACK and "                      \
  "EF_TCP_CLIENT_LOOPBACK); but unsupported socket options and resource "     \
  "limitations can also cause this."

#define HANDOVER_DESCRIPTION_UDP(_x) \
  "All of the handover statistics represent sockets that have been handed "   \
  "to the kernel; and the call that was made that caused this."               \
  "  (In this case " #_x " with a UDP socket)  "                              \

  "via multiple interfaces, and so might not be handed over, but might not "  \

/* Shared Readable User Buffers, shared data structures
 *
 * Once a client connection has been established, it is managed via three
 * shared data structures:
 *
 * The buffers themselves
 * A "server" FIFO, to which the server posts buffers for consumption by clients
 * A "client" FIFO, to which the client posts buffers to release after use
 *
 * The FIFOs are implemented as circularly-addressed arrays sufficiently large
 * to contain all available buffers with at least one empty slot, so that
 * readers can detect newly posted buffers with no further shared state.

  # URL block selects host:port to collect data from
  # Current possible paths are:
  #   /onload/stats/ for global stack statistics
  #   /onload/stack/ for detailed statistics including per-socket counters
  #   /onload/opts/  for per-stack EF_* settings
  #   /onload/lots/  for combined output from "stats", "stack" and "opts"
  #   /onload/all/   for all available data (same as "lots", plus some additional fields)
  #
  # If stack names have been configured (via EF_NAME or onload_set_stackname())
  # stats can be requested for an individual stack using a path like:
  #      /onload/stackname/<name>/lots/
  # (all of the previous options are supported)
  <URL "http://localhost:9000/onload/stats/">
    Instance "onload_stack_stats"
    Interval 30

    # Key to access returned JSON from /onload/stats/
    # Path is json/<index>/<stack-id>/stats/<counter-name>
    # Below gets all counters from all stacks
    # Individual counters can also be extracted,
    # e.g. json/*/*/stats/rx_evs
    <Key "json/*/*/stats/*">
      Type "counter"

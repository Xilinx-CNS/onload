The status of the IP/TCP stack's compliance to various RFCs.
------------------------------------------------------------

This file describes the status of the IP/TCP stack's compliance to
various RFCs and ANVL tests.

ANVL tcp-core tests
===================

The following expected failures for tcp-core 1-18 are explained as
follows.

tcp-core 6.21: "If a RECEIVE call arrives on the SYN-RCVD state, TCP
must queue the request for processing after entering the ESTABLISHED
state" 

  ANVL calls recv on a listening socket which fails and so the
  test fails; this test does not make sense in this form.

tcp-core 6.30: "For a CLOSE call on the SYN-RCVD state, if there is a
pending SEND, TCP must queue the CLOSE call to be processed after
entering the ESTABLISHED state"

  We follow BSD/Linux implementation; drop the data and send a FIN. 

tcp-core 8.28: "TCP, in the TIME-WAIT state, must send an ACK with the
next expected SEQ number after receiving any segment with an OTW SEQ
number and remain in the same state"

  We do not implement the reopening of connections in the TIME-WAIT
  state; rfc1122 section 4.2.2.13 says this is allowed:
	"When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in
	TIME-WAIT state for a time 2xMSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime).
	However, it MAY accept a new SYN from the remote TCP to
	reopen the connection directly from TIME-WAIT state"

tcp-core 11.22: "TCP in the TIME-WAIT state may accept a new SYN from
the remote TCP"

  We do implement the reopening of connections in the TIME-WAIT
  state; rfc1122 section 4.2.2.13 says this should only be done if
  the sequence number on the incomming SYN is higher than any previous
  sequence number.  Unfortunately the ANVL test generates a random
  (new Initial Sequence Number) and will therefore be accepted only
  50% of the time.
  We copy Linux and take any time-stamp on the SYN into accont, allowing
  the reopen if the SYN has a timestamp later than the last one we saw
  on the connection.  ANVL, however, does not use PAWS timestamps and
  so this does not modertate the failure.

tcp-core 12.17: "TCP must be prepared to handle an illegal option
length for MSS, in a SYN,ACK segment, without crashing and should
reset the connection"

  The action after an illegal option is underspecified. We could either
  ignore all options or send a reset; compile time switchs are available to
  set this. The ANVL test expects the connection to send a RST *and*
  progress to the established state; this seems against the spirit of
  sending active RSTs which denote the dropping of a connection in all
  other cases. We fail this test because the generation of a RST also drops
  the connection.

tcp-core 13.18: "A full-sized segment must be acknowledged with a time
of 0.5 seconds"

  Sometimes this test can fail due to ANVL being aggressive with its
  measurement of 0.5 seconds.

tcp-core 14.19: "TCP MUST include an SWS avoidance algorithm in the receiver 
when effective send MSS < (1/2)*RCV_BUFF" (bug 828)

  The ANVL test fills the receive queue by sending a large amount of
  data without having the user call recvmsg at all. It does this until
  it sees a zero receive window advertised in an ACK from our
  stack. Then, it has the application do a recvmsg of less than an MSS,
  sends another single byte to the stack, and checks that the new ACK
  again has a zero window. It is possible that the new ACK will have a
  non-zero window if the receive queue was not previously completely
  full, and so the combination of the space left in the receive queue
  and the space freed up when ANVL receive data together exceeds an
  MSS, allowing the right hand edge receive window to be advanced.
  
  A stack that implements the advice of RFC 1194 section 6.4 of having
  the maximum and initial receive window size set to a multiple of the
  MSS would end up passing this test because there would be exactly no
  data left in the receive queue when the zero window is sent. It also
  happens that the value of CI_CFG_TCP_MAX_WINDOW of 0x7fff, while not
  being a multiple of the 1460 byte MSS, does leave little enough data
  in the receive queue that the test passes. The more obvious 0xffff
  does cause this problem to happen.

  (This begs the question why the receive queue is not completely full
  when the zero window is advertised. This happens when rcv_nxt
  catches up with the last sent receive window right edge, and a new
  right edge cannot be advertised as the window required to do so
  would be less than an MSS, which is forbidden by RFC 1122 SWS
  avoidance.)

  See Bug 828.

tcp-core 15.26: "TCP should use RTO = 3 seconds initially"

  Sometimes this test can fail due to ANVL being aggressive with its
  measurement of 3 seconds.

tcp-core 15.27: "TCP should use RTT = zero seconds initially"

  Sometimes this test can fail because ANVL uses a timing which is too
  aggressive.

tcp-core 15.30: "If a retransmitted packet is identical to the
original packet then the same IP identification field may be used"

  We always increment the IP identification field which is allowed and
  so this test fails.

tcp-core 16.19: "A sending TCP MUST be robust against window shrinking, which 
may cause the "useable window" to become negative"

  ANVL advertises a receive window right edge, then snaps it back, and gets
  our stack to try to send again in the snapped back part of sequence
  space. A design decision in our stack is to ignore receive window snap 
  backs, so our stack will send the data anyway. This violates a SHOULD NOT 
  in RFC 1122 4.2.2.16. There is a risk that if no ACKs are received then 
  eventually the retransmissions will timeout. (See WONTFIX bug 967). 

tcp-core 17.18: "TCP should implement the Nagle Algorithm - that is,
it should buffer all the user data, regardless of the PSH bit, until
the outstanding data has been acknowledged"

  ANVL uses a timing that is too aggressive for the retransmission step
  of the test.

tcp-core 17.19: "TCP should implement the Nagle Algorithm - that is,
it should buffer all user data, regardless of the PSH bit, until the
TCP can send a full-sized segment"

  ANVL uses a timing that is too aggressive for the retransmission step
  of the test.

tcp-core 18.17: "If PUSH flags are not implemented, then the sending
TCP must not buffer data indefinitely"

  We do not support transmission of a non-full MSS into a smaller receive
  window and so fail this test.

tcp-core 18.21: "TCP may aggregate data requested by an applicatoin
for sending until accumulated data exceeds effective send MSS"

  We do not support transmission queue coalesing yet and so fail this
  test.


The following expected failures for tcp-highperf 1-5 have
explainations as follows.

tcp-highperf 2.22: "Except for SYN segments, the window field in the
header of every incoming segment is left-shifted by shift.cnt bits
when using WSopt"

  This fails at least due to RFC 3464 ABC rather than the traditional slow
  start supported by ANVL.

tcp-highperf 2.23: "Except SYN segments, the window field in the
header of every outgoing segment is right-shifted by shift.cnt bits"

  The stack has alledged Linux bug emulation code to set the receive buffer
  size to twice what the application requested. ANVL works out what the
  receive window should be based on the receive buffer size it set, and
  because the actual buffer size is twice what is set ANVL identifies the
  receive window size as bad.

tcp-highperf 3.21: "The Timestamp Echo Reply field (TSecr) is only
valid if the ACK bit is set in the TCP header"

  Sometimes this test can fail because ANVL uses a timing which is too
  aggressive.

tcp-highperf 3.32: "The timestamp from the latest segment (which
filled the hold) must be echoed"

  This ANVL test has a bug. The packet sent by ANVL which is used to 
  fill the hole, in test action 6, is addressed to the wrong port (the 
  expected port + 1). This test therefore fails.

tcp-highperf 7.24: "The data sender MUST retransmit the segment at the
left edge of the window after a retransmit timeout irrespective of the
SACKed bit.
  Due to the difference in slow start algorithms used (we use RFC 3465
  which is not supported by ANVL) this test can sometimes fail.  If
  the cwnd_ini is set (in ANVL) to 2 then the same number of packets
  are expected for both slow-start approaches, and so the test passes.
  This is probably best described as a bug in ANVL.

There are no expected failures for tcp-advanced 1-4.


IETF RFC Compliance
===================

Status can be OK, FAILS, UNKNOWN.


RFC793 - Transmission Control Protocol
======================================

Compliance:
?? TODO - enter all the relevant SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, MAY  ?? 
?? into here along with their current status                  ??

RFC1122 - Requirements for hosts
================================

Compliance:
?? TODO - finsih entering all the relevant SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, MAY  ??
?? into here along with their current status                            ??

4.2.2.16a "A TCP receiver SHOULD NOT shrink the window, i.e., move the 
   right window edge to the left." - OK

4.2.2.16b "a sending TCP MUST be robust against window shrinking. " - we do 
   send data after snapbacks, so if the receiver keeps its window closed for
   too long and does not ACK we may timeout. 

4.2.2.16c "If this [snap back] happens, the sender SHOULD NOT send new data" -
   we do send new data, violating this

RFC2581 - TCP Congestion Control 
================================

Compliance:

3. "... a TCP MUST NOT be more agressive than the following algorithms
   allow" - OK

3.1a "The slow-start and congestion avoidance algorithms MUST be used"
     - OK

3.1b "... the initial value of cwnd, MUST be less than or equal to
     2*SMSS and MUST NOT be more than 2 segments." - Superceded by
     RFC3390 OK

3.1c "Note that during congestion avoidance, cwnd MUST NOT be
     increased by more than the larger of either 1 full-sized segment per
     RTT, or the value computed using equation 2." - OK

3.1d "When a TCP sender detects segment loss using the retransmission
     timer, the value of ssthresh MUST be set to no more than the value
     given in equation 3" - OK

3.1e "When a TCP sender detects segment loss using the retransmission
     timer, the value of ssthresh MUST be set to no more than the value
     given in equation 3" - OK

3.2a "A TCP receiver SHOULD send an immediate duplicate ACK when an out-
     of-order segment arrives." - OK

3.2b "A TCP receiver SHOULD send an immediate duplicate ACK when an out-
     of-order segment arrives." - OK

3.2c "The TCP sender SHOULD use the "fast retransmit" algorithm to detect
     and repair loss, based on incoming duplicate ACKs." - OK

4.1 "Therefore, a TCP SHOULD set cwnd to no more than RW before beginning
    transmission if the TCP has not sent data in an interval exceeding
    the retransmission timeout." - OK

4.2a "The delayed ACK algorithm specified in [Bra89] SHOULD be used by a
     TCP receiver.  When used, a TCP receiver MUST NOT excessively delay
     acknowledgments.  Specifically, an ACK SHOULD be generated for at
     least every second full-sized segment, and MUST be generated within
     500 ms of the arrival of the first unacknowledged packet." - OK

4.2b "The requirement that an ACK "SHOULD" be generated for at least every
     second full-sized segment is listed in [Bra89] in one place as a
     SHOULD and another as a MUST.  Here we unambiguously state it is a
     SHOULD." - OK

4.2c "Out-of-order data segments SHOULD be acknowledged immediately, in
     order to accelerate loss recovery.  To trigger the fast retransmit
     algorithm, the receiver SHOULD send an immediate duplicate ACK when
     it receives a data segment above a gap in the sequence space.  To
     provide feedback to senders recovering from losses, the receiver
     SHOULD send an immediate ACK when it receives a data segment that
     fills in all or part of a gap in the sequence space." - OK

4.2d "A TCP receiver MUST NOT generate more than one ACK for every incoming
     segment, other than to update the offered window as the receiving
     application consumes new data [page 42, Pos81][Cla82]." - OK

4.3a "Therefore, when the first loss in a window of data is detected,
     ssthresh MUST be set to no more than the value given by equation (3).
     Second, until all lost segments in the window of data in question are
     repaired, the number of segments transmitted in each RTT MUST be no
     more than half the number of outstanding segments when the loss was
     detected.  Finally, after all loss in the given window of segments
     has been successfully retransmitted, cwnd MUST be set to no more than
     ssthresh and congestion avoidance MUST be used to further increase
     cwnd." - OK, consequence of fast recovery. 

4.3b "Loss in two successive windows of data, or the loss of a
     retransmission, should be taken as two indications of congestion and,
     therefore, cwnd (and ssthresh) MUST be lowered twice in this case."
     - OK


RFC2582 - The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm
===================================================================

Implemented as an experimental option for fast recovery using the
CI_TCP_NEWRENO compile flag. 

Note we do not do the "bugfix" version to avoid multiple fast
retransmits; instead the whole state is reset on an RTO for safety.

?? We could add a TCP_CONG_CAUTION state which is invoked before
reseting congstate to zero. This would opencwnd but would bypass fast
recovery until the we have fully recovered past congrecover. However
this would require some careful catching in handle_ack. For now we
stick with the naive variant of NewReno, and take the hit of potential
spurious fast retransmit during the recovery phase.


RFC2988 - Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer
==============================================

Compliance: OK 

?? being more agressive with the RTO than the RFC allows could be a
performance improvement but breaks compliance with the spec.

NB see 4. Clock Granularity for discussion of G. The timer management
code is going to be on the fine grained end of things...

(2.1) "Until a round-trip time (RTT) measurement has been made for a
      segment sent between the sender and receiver, the sender SHOULD
      set RTO <- 3 seconds (per RFC 1122 [Bra89]), though the
      "backing off" on repeated retransmission discussed in (5.5)
      still applies." - OK

(2.2) "When the first RTT measurement R is made, the host MUST set

            SRTT <- R
            RTTVAR <- R/2
            RTO <- SRTT + max (G, K*RTTVAR)

         where K = 4." - OK (we ignore G, see comment above)

(2.3) "When a subsequent RTT measurement R' is made, a host MUST set

            RTTVAR <- (1 - beta) * RTTVAR + beta * |SRTT - R'|
            SRTT <- (1 - alpha) * SRTT + alpha * R'

      The value of SRTT used in the update to RTTVAR is its value
      before updating SRTT itself using the second assignment.  That
      is, updating RTTVAR and SRTT MUST be computed in the above
      order.

      The above SHOULD be computed using alpha=1/8 and beta=1/4 (as
      suggested in [JK88]).

      After the computation, a host MUST update
      RTO <- SRTT + max (G, K*RTTVAR)" - OK, we use Jacobson 88.

(2.4) "Whenever RTO is computed, if it is less than 1 second then the
       RTO SHOULD be rounded up to 1 second." - OK, we use 1 second.
      Some stacks are more agressive allowing 200ms, this could improve 
      performance.

(2.5) "A maximum value MAY be placed on RTO provided it is at least 60
         seconds." - OK

3a "TCP MUST use Karn's algorithm [KP87] for taking RTT samples.  That
   is, RTT samples MUST NOT be made using segments that were
   retransmitted (and thus for which it is ambiguous whether the reply
   was for the first instance of the packet or a later instance).  The
   only case when TCP can safely take RTT samples from retransmitted
   segments is when the TCP timestamp option [JBB92] is employed, since
   the timestamp option removes the ambiguity regarding which instance
   of the data segment triggered the acknowledgment." - OK 

3b "A TCP implementation MUST take at least one RTT measurement per
   RTT (unless that is not possible per Karn's algorithm)." - OK we
   take one every window without TS option, which is close
   enough to every RTT...

5  "An implementation MUST manage the retransmission timer(s) in such a
   way that a segment is never retransmitted too early, i.e. less than
   one RTO after the previous transmission of that segment." - OK, the ip 
   timer code always fires after a tick not before. 

(5.1)  "Every time a packet containing data is sent (including a
       retransmission), if the timer is not running, start it running
       so that it will expire after RTO seconds (for the current value
       of RTO)." - OK

(5.2) "When all outstanding data has been acknowledged, turn off the
      retransmission timer." - OK

(5.3) "When an ACK is received that acknowledges new data, restart the
      retransmission timer so that it will expire after RTO seconds
      (for the current value of RTO)." - OK

(5.4) "Retransmit the earliest segment that has not been acknowledged
      by the TCP receiver." - UNKNOWN pending retransmission stuff

(5.5) "The host MUST set RTO <- RTO * 2 ("back off the timer").  The
      maximum value discussed in (2.5) above may be used to provide an
      upper bound to this doubling operation." - OK

(5.6) "(5.6) Start the retransmission timer, such that it expires after RTO
      seconds (for the value of RTO after the doubling operation
      outlined in 5.5)." - OK


RFC3390 - Increasing TCP's Initial Window
=========================================

Compliance:
?? TODO: congestion window validation implementation for RW  ??
?? TODO: PMTU code implementation needed                     ??

1a "This increased initial window is optional: a TCP MAY start with a
   larger initial window." - Supported and superceding RFC2581 OK.

1b "Neither the SYN/ACK nor its acknowledgment (ACK) in the three-way
   handshake should increase the initial window size above that outlined
   in equation (1). If the SYN or SYN/ACK is lost, the initial window
   used by a sender after a correctly transmitted SYN MUST be one segment
   consisting of MSS bytes." - OK

1c "TCP implementations use slow start in as many as three different
   ways: (1) to start a new connection (the initial window); (2) to
   restart transmission after a long idle period (the restart window);
   and (3) to restart transmission after a retransmit timeout (the loss
   window).  The change specified in this document affects the value of
   the initial window.  Optionally, a TCP MAY set the restart window to
   the minimum of the value used for the initial window and the current
   value of cwnd (in other words, using a larger value for the restart
   window should never increase the size of cwnd).  These changes do NOT
   change the loss window, which must remain 1 segment of MSS bytes..." 
   - IW OK, RW unimplemented UNKNOWN, LW unimplemented UNKNOWN

2. "When larger initial windows are implemented along with Path MTU
   Discovery [RFC1191], and the MSS being used is found to be too large,
   the congestion window `cwnd' SHOULD be reduced to prevent large bursts
   of smaller segments." - Awaiting PMTU support RFC1191 UNKNOWN


RFC3465 - TCP Congestion Control with Appropriate Byte Counting (ABC) 
=====================================================================

Compliance: OK

2.3a  "... ABC with L=1*SMSS bytes is more conservative in a number of
     key ways (as discussed in the next section) and therefore,
     this document suggests that even though with L=1*SMSS bytes TCP
     stacks will see little performance change, ABC SHOULD be used." 
      and
     "This document specifies that TCP implementations MAY use L=2*SMSS
     bytes and MUST NOT use L > 2*SMSS bytes." - OK, we use L=1*SMSS
     because of 2.3b, if cheap to check whether in slow-start
     following RTO then could use L=2*SMSS.

2.3b "The exception to the above suggestion is during a slow start phase
     that follows a retransmission timeout (RTO).  In this situation, a
     TCP MUST use L=1*SMSS as specified in RFC 2581 since ACKs for large
     amounts of previously unacknowledged data are common during this
     phase of a transfer.  These ACKs do not necessarily indicate how much
     data has left the network in the last RTT, and therefore ABC cannot
     accurately determine how much to increase cwnd." - OK, but makes
     use more conservative in initial slow start.


Observed behaviour in other stack implementations
-------------------------------------------------

1. 2004/06/10, stg, Linux 2.4/RH9 stack, Use of lo device

 In the following configurations: 
   
   eth2:192.168.10.1/24, eth3:192.168.10.2/24 
   eth2:192.168.10.1/24, eth3:192.168.11.1/24 
 
 A UDP packet sent from eth2 -> eth3 will be delivered through lo.  The
 implication being that the lo device is the local host loopback rather 
 than the interface loopback. (ctk: compliant behaviour).

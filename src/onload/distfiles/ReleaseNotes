hlrx API defined in extensions_zc_hlrx.h.


Alveo X3522 net driver version
------------------------------

X3522 users should upgrade the X3522 net driver to v1.6.3, which is
the only version supported with this version of Onload.


Onload Operator for Kubernetes and OpenShift
--------------------------------------------

A major new version of the Onload Operator for Kubernetes and OpenShift has
been released. Version 3.0 of the operator should be used for orchestrating
the deployment of Onloaded workloads in supported environments with the Multus
CNI. Version 2.0 and earlier are obsolete. Release notes area available at
<https://github.com/Xilinx-CNS/kubernetes-onload/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md>.

===============

 This is an update release of Onload to fix various bugs in
 OpenOnload-8.1.1.17, add version 5.3.16.1004 of the sfc net driver
 and support recent operating system updates.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------

 This package can be installed on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 - 8.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 - 9.3

your sales representative or <nic-sales@amd.com> for more information.


Interface names may change (but not since Onload 8.x)
-----------------------------------------------------

Onload 8.x includes the v5.x sfc net driver. When updating from the in-tree
sfc driver or an earlier Onload release (7.x or earlier), some OS
configurations may result in interface names changing.

Onload-8.1.1.17
===============

 This is an update release of Onload to fix various bugs in
 OpenOnload-8.1.0.15 and extend support for new kernels.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------

 This package can be installed on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 - 8.8
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 - 9.2
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 - SP5
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04 and 22.04
 - Debian 11 "Bullseye"
 - Debian 12 "Bookworm"
 - Linux kernels 4.15 - 6.4


kernel.org Linux kernels 6.2 - 6.4
----------------------------------

 In addition to suporting new Linux kernel 6.4, this update includes
 support for kernels 6.2 and 6.3 which was intended for but not present
 in the Onload-8.1.0.15 release.


Querying X3 queue exclusivity status
------------------------------------

 The ef_vi_filter_query API now gives the exclusivity status of a given filter.
 This is done via the EF_FILTER_IS_EXCLUSIVE flag.


Onload-8.1.0.15
===============

 This is a feature release of Onload with extended support for the
 Alveo™ XtremeScale™ X3522 low latency network adapter and added support for
 new operating systems and kernels.

 Various features and fixes since OpenOnload-8.0.2.51 are included and
 version 5.3.14.1019 of the sfc net driver for X2-based network cards.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------

 This package can be installed on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 - 8.8
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 - 9.2
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 - SP5
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04 and 22.04
 - Debian 11 "Bullseye"
 - Debian 12 "Bookworm"
 - Linux kernels 4.15 - 6.3


Alveo X3522
-----------

Onload on the Alveo X3522 requires a compatible net driver version from
https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/x3.html#software such
as v1.5.2.0 at the time of writing. Older kernels such as on RHEL 7.9 and
RHEL 8.4 also require the auxiliary bus driver to be installed (available
from the same download page). See X3522 released notes and documentation.


Controlling exclusive access to X3 Rx queues
--------------------------------------------

Onload-8.1 introduces a new mechanism for enabling users to reserve
a hardware receive queue for a given singular application. This
mechanism is currently only supported on X3522 Network Cards.

This is via a new filter flag (EF_FILTER_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE_RXQ)
that is applied via ef_filter_spec_init. With this change,
users can ensure the following properties for their application.

1) Other applications will be unable to snoop on traffic filtered to this
   application.
2) This application can guarantee that it will not receive any packets
   for which it did not explicitly add a filter.

In addition, this version of Onload introduces a new function,
ef_filter_spec_set_dest(). This API enables the user to specify which hardware
receive queue an application can listen on.

Due to the additional granularity afforded by the above granular controls,
this version has necessitated the deprecation of the following broader EF_VI
application flags.

- EF_VI_EFCT_UNIQUEUE
- EF_VI_RX_EXCLUSIVE

Further details of specific exclusivity conditions can be found under the
EF_FILTER_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE_RXQ documentation.


Hardware filter IDs on X3522
----------------------------

New features have been added to ef_vi to allow applications to reuse the result
of the hardware packet parsing and filtering which X3 has done on rx. The new
ef_vi_filter_query() will return the ID which the NIC has allocated for a
previously-added filter, which will match the ef_event.rx_ref.filter_id field
returned by an ef_vi_poll() call.

Note that ef_vi will not always use on-NIC filtering to satisfy a call to
ef_vi_filter_add(), and so ef_vi_filter_query() has the ability to report that
no filter ID is available; applications should be written to be robust to this
scenario.


IPv6 on X3522
-------------

When using IPv6 with an onload accelerated socket on X3522 received IPv6
fragments will be dropped.


Transmit path warming on X3522
------------------------------

Onload-8.1 adds new features to allow the transmit code path to be exercised
without sending any data on the wire. This can potentially improve latency when
transmitting after a period of inactivity, as recently executed code is more
likely to be cached. This functionality is available via both ef_vi and
TCPDirect APIs.

ef_vi: Use efct_vi_start_transmit_warm() and efct_vi_stop_transmit_warm() to
start and stop warming. Call transmit functions while warming to exercise the
code. These functions are only usable for EFCT (X3) NICs.

TCPDirect: Use zft_send_single_warm() and zfut_send_single_warm(). These
functions are not new, but Onload-8.1 extends them to be usable for any NIC
architecture including EFCT (X3).


TCPDirect
---------

Since v8.0.0, TCPDirect has been provided in a separately released package
sharing the same base version number (x.y.z) as the Onload version with which
it must be used.


Deprecation of RHEL 7
---------------------

Future feature releases of OpenOnload may not include support for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.x. Long Term Support for Onload 8.1 including on RHEL 7.9
will be available in the form of EnterpriseOnload 8.1. Please ask your sales
representative for details.
